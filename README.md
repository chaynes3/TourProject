# TourProject

This was a project completed while pursuing my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from FLorida Southern College.  The assignment comes from the required algorithms course <b><i>and was completed in groups of two</i></b>.

Assignment Instructions:

**Task 1: Creating a Set of Frank Lloyd Wright Architecture**

Create a set of all of the Frank Lloyd Wright architecture found on the FSC campus. You can use the map found by following the link below (make sure that just the Frank Lloyd Wright Architecture is selected under the map filter).  Exclude the parking lots and buildings at the tourism center on the corner of FLW Way & Johnson Ave. Place this set of buildings in your Word document.

**Task 2: Generating Subsets**

Using your set from Task 1, create a funciton that will take your set and generate all subsets of it. You will want to print all possible subsets.

**Task 3: Create a Weighted Graph**

Using the same collection of architecture from Task 1, create a weighted graph where the vertices are the individual pieces of architecture. Two vertices will have an edge between them if there is a sidewalk that connects the two pieces of architecture. The weight of the edge will be the distance between the two pieces of architecture. Draw your graph in your Word document (I would recommend using the drawing tool in PowerPoint and then copy/paste the graph into Word).

After you have your graph drawn out, encode it in either an adjacency list or adjacency matrix. Place this encoded graph in both your Word document and your source code (as a properly named variable).

**Task 4: Pick a Subset of Architecture**

Next, have your program ask the what set of architectures they would like to visit.  Limit it to a number between (inclusive) 3 and 6 pieces of architecture.

**Task 5: Find the Optimal Route**

Lastly, using the graph from Task 3, find the optimal route (defined as shortest) for the user to take walking tour and visit each piece of architecture. Add your algorithm for finding the optimal route to your Word Document and then code the algorithm into your program.

Hint:You will probably want to generate every permuatation and the total weight of said permuation.

**Task 6: Odds & Ends**

Ensure that your program runs, presents the user with appropriate menus/prompts, and is logical to use. It does not have to be GUI based, but can be if you so choose. You must follow all programming conventions. You can assume the user will always enter proper data, formated as you instruct; i.e. I will not TRY to break your program.

**Task 7: Test Your Program!**

Test your program to ensure it is working. If you are on campus (either living or commuting), then I would like you to do a real-world test and take photos along the way. Bonus points (up to 10 points) if you post your photos on social media and tag the Department's &l; College's social media accounts with the hashtag #CSAlgorithms #FrankLloydWrightTour.

**Deliverable:**

Your source code file and Word Document with your write up.
